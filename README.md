# DIA_VISION_123
DIA_VISION is the smart detection of diabetic retinopathy using AI algorithm.
Early referral of diabetic retinopathy to ophthalmologists is crucial for improving glycemic control and reducing progression.
 However, challenges like lack of awareness, limited access, and the need for expensive equipment hinder screening. 
Tele-ophthalmology can make screening more accessible but
requires trained readers and ophthalmologists.
A smart diabetic retinopathy device that utilizes AI algorithms can be a valuable tool for early detection and management of diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes that
can lead to vision loss if not diagnosed and treated promptly
